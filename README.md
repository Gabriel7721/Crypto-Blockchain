# SimpleChain---A-Minimalist-Blockchain-Simulator
PyBlockSim: A Python blockchain prototype for educational use. Features block creation, proof-of-work, chain validation, and a basic transaction ledger.
SimpleChain is a compact and educational blockchain simulator written in Python. This project showcases the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology, including block creation, chain integrity verification, proof-of-work, and basic transaction ledger to calculate balances. Designed for learners and enthusiasts, SimpleChain offers a hands-on experience with the core mechanics that power blockchain-based systems. Dive into the code to explore a genesis block creation, block linking through hashes, nonce discovery for proof-of-work, and a simplistic transaction system for a mock cryptocurrency ledger. It's an ideal starting point for anyone interested in the inner workings of blockchain technology or looking to create their own simplified cryptocurrency simulation.
